Standard Long Instructions

These instructions require 32 bits to represent,
using the Long Instruction format.

Instruction Packet:

    0xF 0x1  A B
    0x0  op  H L

The 0x0 is the "extension ID" and nonzero values are
reserved for implementors to use freely.

op:
    0x0 Multiply
        (H, L) = A * B

    0x1 Divide
        A = (H, L) / A
        B = (H, Lo1) % B
