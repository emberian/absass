\title{CRAP-1}

The CRAP is an experimental computing platform for ABSASS-compatible
processors. Its goal is simplicity, in particular:

\li Simplicity in developing software to simulate real devices; and

\li Simplicity in the implementation of compatible hardware.

Where possible, the goal is also to be as platform-agnostic as possible, in the
spirit of the ABSASS architecture; what can possibly be configurable is left
configurable, and thus exact values are outside the scope of this document.

The most important part of this specification is the "initial program state",
or IPS. The IPS is the state of the processor when it is passed to the first
"general purpose" program--id est, it is permissible in a given hardware design
that some other program (e.g. firmware) shall run to bring the processor into
the IPS, so long as the requirements of the IPS are satisfied.
